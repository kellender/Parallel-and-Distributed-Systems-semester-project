How to mount the server
1) make the server ny make Srvr
2) open 3 terminals and run each server in each terminal
	ex server 1 gets a terminal, server 2 gets a terminal etc


testing
-kill the first server, the other servers sould take over
-kill the second server the last server should take over
-kill server (2 or 3) or (2 and 3) the first server should still be running


replicas were hard coded!!!!
server replication was copied and pasted to make it similer to a server in different parts of the country [world]

if server was actually a server taht server customers then DNS would resolve the limited port issue that i hardcoded


Enjoy!!!
